# graph_theory
The main graph theory code that I worked on is lab property so it can not be shared here, but the convert_sensor.py converts from sensor to source space. 
Graph_theory.Rmd is an R markdown file that takes all the outputs from the graph theory code and performs statistical analysis on it.
